# trendlines
A python command line tool to help me kill time without opening browsers. This tool is created to meet my needs to do everything on command line, including reading news and checking weather, etc. I will keep adding new functionalities as time goes by.

It is also the first time I use <b>Docopt</b> to build a command line tool, and I absolutely like it. For the news API, I used the API from my previous internship employer - Wordlink. It collects and ranks thousands of thousands of posts on social media and news portals.

Example usage for news:
To get 10 most popular news about ottawa : trendlines news ottawa -n 10
